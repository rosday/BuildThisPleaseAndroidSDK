# BuildThisPlease Android SDK

Reusable Android client and Jetpack Compose UI for the BuildThisPlease feature-request system. It shares the same projects, tickets, comments, votes, dashboard, and D1 database as the iOS SDK.

The Compose surface mirrors the iOS workflow: counted title and description fields, optional support email, Requests/Mine/Done sections, status-aware voting, implemented release notes, installation-owned comment editing, locked conversations, adaptive large-screen navigation, pull-to-refresh, loading and empty states, and retry-safe mutations.

## Modules

- `buildthisplease-core`: API client, encrypted installation session storage, Android Keystore signing, and Google Play Integrity proofs.
- `buildthisplease-compose`: ready-to-use feature-request board and conversation UI.
- `sample`: runnable mock-backed demonstration; no account or backend is required.
- `buildthisplease-nano`: optional Gemini Nano translation adapter for hosts with minSdk 26+.
- `sample-nano`: separate mock-feedback demonstration of the adapter; checks real device availability.

## Local integration

Add the SDK as a composite build in the consuming app's `settings.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
includeBuild("../BuildThisPleaseAndroidSDK")
```

Then add:

```kotlin
    implementation("io.github.rosday:buildthisplease-compose:0.1.5")
```

Create one client at application scope and display it from Compose:

```kotlin
val client = BuildThisPleaseClient(
    context = applicationContext,
    configuration = BuildThisPleaseConfiguration(
        baseUrl = "https://feedback.keinois.com",
        projectKey = "btp_pk_your_publishable_project_key",
        environment = BuildThisPleaseConfiguration.Environment.PRODUCTION,
    ),
)

BuildThisPleaseFeedback(client = client, onBack = { /* navigate back */ })
```

`BuildThisPleaseFeedback` is the standalone surface and owns its list, create, and detail navigation. Apps that already use Navigation Compose can instead place the route-specific surfaces in their own graph:

The standalone surface can also hand just those two route decisions to its host by setting
`onOpenRequest` and/or `onCreateRequest`; omitted callbacks keep the built-in navigation.

```kotlin
BuildThisPleaseFeedbackList(
    client = client,
    stateKey = "feedback",
    onOpenTicket = { ticketId -> navController.navigate("feedback/$ticketId") },
    onCreateRequest = { navController.navigate("feedback/new") },
)

BuildThisPleaseTicketDetail(
    client = client,
    ticketId = ticketId,
    stateKey = "feedback",
    onBack = navController::popBackStack,
)

BuildThisPleaseCreateRequest(
    client = client,
    stateKey = "feedback",
    onBack = navController::popBackStack,
    onCreated = navController::popBackStack,
)
```

Use a stable, unique `stateKey` for each feedback project. The SDK retains loaded state across configuration changes and restores the selected section and request after process recreation.

Create one long-lived client per project. Update that retained client when optional subscription or support identity changes. The request form also allows a user to provide an optional support email; the SDK normalizes it and sends it only when entered.

The `btp_pk_…` project key is publishable identification, not an administrator secret. Do not place a Google service-account key, dashboard token, or Cloudflare credential in an Android app.

## Localization

The Compose UI ships Android resources for the same 32 non-English locales as the iOS SDK: Arabic, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Filipino, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Croatian, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian Bokmål, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, and Simplified and Traditional Chinese.

Android selects these resources from the device or app locale automatically. To expose the languages in Android 13+ per-app language settings, enable AGP's generated locale configuration in the consuming application module:

```kotlin
android {
    androidResources {
        generateLocaleConfig = true
    }
}
```

Also add `src/main/res/resources.properties` to that application module:

```properties
unqualifiedResLocale=en
```

The sample enables this configuration. The SDK does not change the host application's locale or require an in-app language picker. Shared translations can be refreshed with `python3 scripts/import_ios_localizations.py ../BuildThisPleaseSDK`; native-speaker review should remain part of release QA.

## Optional on-device translation with Gemini Nano

Core, Compose, and the original sample retain minSdk 24. The optional Nano artifact requires
minSdk 26 because Google's Prompt API dependency requires it. Android version alone does not
establish eligibility: the device must have a supported AICore model already installed and ready.

For local composite-build integration, replace the Compose dependency with:

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.rosday:buildthisplease-nano:0.1.5")
```

The new artifact is available from this checkout; it will be available on Maven Central only after
the next SDK release. It includes Compose transitively. Retain one provider alongside your client:

```kotlin
val translations = NanoTranslationProvider(
    cacheNamespace = projectKey, // the same publishable project key used by this client
    supportedLanguages = setOf("en", "es"), // source and target languages evaluated for your app
)

BuildThisPleaseFeedback(client = client, translationProvider = translations)
```

Pass the same provider to `BuildThisPleaseFeedbackList` and `BuildThisPleaseTicketDetail` when the
host owns navigation. The host owns the provider; call `translations.close()` only after its
feedback destinations have been disposed. Use a different namespace/provider for each project.

The provider uses Nano only when `checkStatus()` returns `AVAILABLE`. `DOWNLOADABLE`, `DOWNLOADING`,
`UNAVAILABLE`, readiness errors, and readiness timeouts leave original text visible. The SDK never
calls the model download or warmup APIs, requests installation, offers a download prompt, or uses a
cloud translation fallback. AICore may independently manage or update its shared system models.

While the feedback screen is resumed, ticket titles, descriptions, implementation notes, and
non-hidden messages are translated into the app's active language. Editing and sending retain the
original text. Changed results display “Translated · AI” with “Show original” / “Show translation”
controls. Empty, uncertain, same-language, and unsupported fields retain originals. Malformed,
truncated, or failed results are not displayed; recoverable failures offer “Try again”.

Use BCP-47 tags in `supportedLanguages`. A base tag such as `es` covers regional variants while the
requested region is retained in the prompt. Use `zh-Hans` and `zh-Hant` explicitly for Chinese
scripts. Explicit regions, variants, and extensions restrict eligibility to matching tags.
This allowlist is a host evaluation policy, not a guarantee of model quality. Evaluate
source/target pairs on the Nano versions your users run before expanding it. Google's Prompt API
is beta and model output varies across devices: see [prompt evaluation](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/genai/prompt/android/evaluate-prompt).

One inference runs at a time per provider, with duplicate requests sharing results. Backgrounding
the screen cancels its work and hides translations; eligibility is rechecked on resume and before
each request. Temporary busy errors receive two bounded retries. Quota exhaustion stops automatic
work across all active scopes sharing the provider until a later resume. Oversized content is split at paragraph/word boundaries and displayed
only after every part succeeds.

Translations share a cache across list/detail screens, partitioned by project namespace, original
content, target locale, model identifier, prompt version, and evaluated language allowlist. The cache expires after 30 days,
retains at most 500 groups, and bounds the disk file to 2 MiB. It stores hashed keys and changed
translations rather than another copy of unchanged originals. Cached translations are also hidden
when the model is unavailable. Cache persistence is best effort.

Build the separate demo with `./gradlew :sample-nano:assembleDebug`. It uses mock feedback and a
demo-only English/Spanish allowlist; it does not weaken Play Integrity or contact the backend.
Without an already-ready model it displays the normal feedback UI. For offline device validation,
prepare the model outside this SDK before disconnecting the network; the SDK itself never installs it.

## Google Play setup

Production apps must be recognized by Google Play Integrity. For each distinct Play package:

1. Link the Play Console app to the Google Cloud project used for Play Integrity.
2. Enable the Play Integrity API and grant the backend service account permission to decode tokens.
3. Register the package name, Play App Signing SHA-256 certificate, Cloud project number, and environment in BuildThisPlease.
4. Upload the build to a Play testing or production track. A locally sideloaded production APK is not `PLAY_RECOGNIZED` and normally is not `LICENSED`.

The Cloud project number is returned by the backend challenge. A consuming app does not embed a service-account credential and does not need custom token-verification code.

## Trying the sample

Set `sdk.dir` in `local.properties`, then run:

```shell
./gradlew :sample:assembleDebug
```

The sample starts in mock mode and includes developer controls for mock scenarios, subscription state, appearance, data reset, and staging/production configuration. Supply optional local Gradle properties to exercise a Play-installed staging or production build:

```properties
BTP_STAGING_BASE_URL=https://staging.example.com
BTP_STAGING_PROJECT_KEY=btp_pk_...
BTP_PRODUCTION_BASE_URL=https://feedback.example.com
BTP_PRODUCTION_PROJECT_KEY=btp_pk_...
```

These publishable project keys may be local build configuration; Play Integrity service-account and signing credentials must never be placed here. Mock mode proves integration and UI without weakening production integrity requirements.

The mock supports normal, empty, loading, offline, rate-limited, expired-session, and server-error scenarios for previews and automated tests.

## Privacy and Play Data Safety

The SDK does not request contacts, advertising identifiers, location, or media permissions. It sends the app package/signing identity, app and OS versions, an installation identifier, feature requests, votes, and conversation messages. A host may additionally provide subscription state, RevenueCat App User ID, or support email. Declare the data your app actually supplies in Google Play Data Safety and in the host app's privacy policy. Do not provide optional identity data without an appropriate user-facing purpose and legal basis.

When the optional Nano adapter is included, inference input and output remain on-device. ML Kit
also collects diagnostic/usage metrics, including app/device information, identifiers, configured
languages, input/output sizes, performance, and error information. Account for this optional
dependency in the host app's disclosures: [ML Kit privacy](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms)
and [Google Play data disclosure guidance](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/android-data-disclosure).

## Distribution

The SDK is released under the MIT License. Tagged releases are published to Maven Central as `io.github.rosday:buildthisplease-core` and `io.github.rosday:buildthisplease-compose`. The local composite-build integration remains available for SDK development.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the trust model and operational cautions.

Each submitted request includes the host app version as private backend metadata. The version is captured from the SDK configuration (which defaults to the host app version) and is not included in public request responses.
